                  Based in Hyderabad, India, our journey into filmmaking began with a shared passion for 
                  storytelling that transcends cultural boundaries. As an emerging filmmaking collective, we're focused 
                  on developing short films that blend the technical precision of Western cinema 
                  with the rich narrative traditions of Indian storytelling.

                  While we're new to the craft of filmmaking, we bring our combined perspectives and a 
                  deep understanding of cinematic language. Our background in Hyderabad has given us a 
                  unique viewpoint that we're eager to share through our work.

                  Currently, we're developing several short film projects that explore themes of identity, 
                  perception, and timeâ€”concepts that have fascinated us throughout our journey as film enthusiasts.
